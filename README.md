Tailwind CSS

You can tweak the design by editing tailwind.config.js. Here’s a snippet showing where to add your customizations:

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./src/index.html"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Your custom styles here
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}

TypeScript

The TypeScript settings are in tsconfig.json. It’s configured to use strict mode and support React’s JSX.
